# Enot

Enot is a Georgian equivalent of a cute animal - a raccoon, Which we think suits our product the most. ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶	

Our business concept is to offer fashion, quality, and cuteness at the best price in a sustainable way. 	

# Description
Enot is a new Georgian clothing brand that was brought into the world through a progression of spring-up stores in 2022.

Since our brand is new, we have jackets, shirts, and dresses at this moment. According to this, our app has few functions at this time, on which we are currently working to add new ones.

With our app, you can see our pieces of art. 
Unfortunately, you can not buy using this app, but we're working on that.
